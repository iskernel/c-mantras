c-mantras
========

c-mantras is a collection of C libraries I developed in my early college years. I will add more stuff to it whenever I get into a spartan mood and feel the need to implement algorithms in the rawest way possible.

Feel free to contribute. Bear in mind that this library is in early development (didn't event added all of my college stuff).

Currently it contains the following modules:
 - **base**  
  - *cm_string* - helpers for string operations [Partially tested]
 - **numerics** 
  - *cm_narray* - helpers for numeric array operations (min,max,means,etc) [Partially tested]
  - *cm_nmatrix* - helpers for numeric matrix operations (sum, product, minor, determinand, adjugate, inverse, etc) [Not tested]
 - **algorithms** 
  - *cm_colorspace* - RGB, HSI, HSL, HSV, YUV, YIQ conversion helpers [Not tested]
